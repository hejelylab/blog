### What is Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)?

**TL;DR**
> WMI is a feature which allows querying, collecting, and managing Windows OS components eihter locally or remotely<br>

**A bit Longer Definition**
> WMI is a Microsoft implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) in Windows OS<br><br>
What is WBEM?   
- It is an open standard called the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) which aims to exchange Comon Information Model (CIM) data between systems<br><br>
What is CIM?
- It is a data model standard which allows hardware, Operating Systems or applications for example to define classes that represent the different components they have. An example would be a class that represents information about hardisk<br>

<br>
**Example**
I would like to know the details about services on my system, and in specific DHCP service. I would write the following powershell command<br>
`Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/CIMV2 -ClassName CIM_Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "dhcp"}`<br>
With WMI, we are able to have powerful tasks gets accomplished such as creating processes remotely.

**How is WMI organized?**
It is organized into Namespaces > Classes > Instances <br>
Essentially, namespace may contain different classes, and classes can have one or more instances.
This is clear in the previous example, another example where there is one instance for this class<br>
`Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/CIMV2 -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem`<br>
output is the OS instance information<br>
<br>

**How does WMI provide us info about the operating system?**
This could be understood by looking at WMI architecture

### WMI Architecture
WMI consists of 3 components:<br>
- WMI Providers & Managed Objects<br>
		So for any component to have its information available via WMI. It needs to have a provider which handles requests and queries about this object
    - Providers consist of two components which are<br>
	    - DLL File
	    - Managed Object Format (MOF)
			- CIM scripts which describe classes that are available in WMI repository.
- WMI Infrastructure<br>
	- WMI core (WMI service) and WMI repository (C:\Windows\System32\wbem\repository)
- WMI Consumers<br>
	These are basically what can query WMI repository such as
	- Powershell
	- WMIC (WMI command-line utility)
	- Programming languages such as C#, C++, VB, etc.
			
<br>
### How to access WMI repository?
Using one of two protocols which are<br>
- Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
	- First, What is COM? 
	    > COM is a standard which specifies how objects or components can interact with other components whether they are in the same process or in different processes on the same computer<br>
	- What is DCOM?
	    > DCOM is the idea of having components or objects interact with other components even if they are in different systems<br>
		For a component to request a service from another component in another system, this request can be forwarded to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol which acts as the transmission protocol<br>
- WinRM
	- WinRM is Microsoft implementation of protocol called WSMAN.
		- What is WSMAN?<br>
		    > It is a messaging protocol for exchanging information between a server and a client. It often relies on HTTP.

### WMI Attacks
WMI can be leveraged by attackers in several post exploitation phases
- Reconnaissance
- Privilege Escalation
- Lateral Movement
- Persistence
	
> I will explain with examples how WMI is used in only the latter two phases: Lateral movement & Persistence<br>
In addition, I'll explain approaches to detect them
	
---

### WMI Lateral Movement
Two examples to perform lateral movement using WMI are
- wmi process call create
- wmiexec.py<br>

> This is a fileless lateral movement, no need for the existence of any file on the target system, WMI will achieve the task<br>
Communication will appear over port TCP 135 in the beginning, and then later a random port will be used after negotiation succeeds between the two systems<br>
<br>

**WMI Lateral Movement Detection Example**

Scenario<br>
- In this example we will run "CMD /c ipconfig.exe" on remote system using WMIC command line utility, and confirm the observed events in both source and target systems.
- Used WMIC command<br>
 `wmic.exe /NODE:172.16.1.12 /USER:"hejelylab\Administrator" /PASSWORD:"UserPassword" process call create "cmd.exe /c ipconfig.exe"`<br>
 
- Eventlogs
    - Security Event logs<br>
			You need to have Command Line Auditing Enabled.
			No logs appeared to me in this example if command line logging is not enabled and sysmon is installed.
		- Source
		    - Security logs, event ID: 4688  
			    - Process name: WMIC.exe
				- Parent process name: cmd.exe
		- Target
			- Security logs, event ID: 4688
				- Process name: calc.exe
				- Parent process name: WmiPrvSE.exe
	- Sysmon Event logs
		- Source
			- Sysmon logs, event ID: 1
				- Process name: WMIC.exe
				- Parent process name: cmd.exe
		- Target
			- Sysmon logs, event ID: 1
				- Process name: calc.exe
				- Parent process name: WmiPrvSE.exe

### WMI Persistence
WMI persistence can be achieved via WMI event subscription for example<br>
Steps: <br>
- An MOF file gets created<br>
- MOF file contains the following:<br>
	- Event Trigger (Class __EventFilter)
	    - An example, event trigger is a specific date, an event that occurs on thestem (notepad.exe starts)
	- Event Consumer (Class __EventConsumer)
	    - What will happen once the trigger occurs, for example, run a specific script command.
	- Binding (class __FilterToConsumerBinding)
	    - This  what binds the consumer to the trigger.
		
- Compile MOF file
	- Using mofcomp.exe
		
Persistence is achieved!!!

**WMI Persistence Detection Examples**

**First Example**
Scenario<br>
- A MOF file is dropped to system
- The MOF file gets compiled using mofcomp.exe (mofcomp is spawned by powershell) <br>
WMI event consumer event is executed (The example here is to run BATCH script which will execute cmd)<br>

Detection
- Sysmon
	- Event ID 1: powershell > mofcomp.exe .\a.mof
	- Event ID 20: WmiConsumerEvent
	- Event ID 21: WmiBindingEvent
			

- WMI-Activity Operational Log
    - Event ID 5861: records permanent event consumer creation<br>
![second screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/210410-2_WMI.png)

- Security
	- Event ID 4688: powershell > mofcomp.exe .\a.mof
			
All events in one table

Note (Different example): Sysmon also triggers for WMI event filter in Event ID: 19.

**Second Example,WMI detection using WMI**
I will compile the following MOF file in advance to view valid results of WMI detection using WMI<br>
Executed command: mofcomp.exe .\LogonTime.mof<br>
LogonTime.mof<br>
- Purpose: After being compile, for any interactive logon "LogonType=2", CMD will be run and echo date and time into "C:\\Users\\administrator\\Downloads\\LogonTime.txt"
	
- LogonTime.mof Content<br>

> #pragma namespace ("\\\\.\\root\\subscription")<br>
> instance of __EventFilter as $FILTER<br>
{<br>
    Name = "VBScript Filter";<br>
    EventNamespace = "root\\cimv2";<br>
 Query = "SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 5 WHERE (TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_LogonSession' AND (TargetInstance.LogonType = 2))";<br>
    QueryLanguage = "WQL";<br>
};<br>
instance of ActiveScriptEventConsumer as $CONSUMER<br>
{<br>
    Name = "VBScript CMD Consumer";<br>
    ScriptingEngine = "VBScript";<br>
    ScriptText =
      "Set objShell = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\n"
   "objShell.Run \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C echo %date%%time% > C:\\Users\\administrator\\Downloads\\LogonTime.txt\"\n";<br>
};<br>
instance of __FilterToConsumerBinding<br>
{<br>
    Consumer = $CONSUMER ;<br>
    Filter = $FILTER ;<br>
};<br>


Once logging out and logging again interactively, ipconfig will be executed.
> Remember that MOF contains 
- trigger filter (__EventFilter), 
- consumer (__EventConsumer), and 
- Binding (__FilterToConsumerBinding)<br>

<br>
We can fetch this infomation using the following powershell cmdlets<br>
`Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName __EventFilter`

![fifth screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/210410-5_WMI.png)

`Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName __EventConsumer`

![sixth screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/210410-6_WMI.png)

`Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/subscription -ClassName __FilterToConsumerBinding`

![seventh screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/210410-7_WMI.png)

**Third Example**
- WMI Repository file
	- File Name: OBJECTS.DAT
	- Location: C:\Windows\System32\wbem\Repository
	- Purpose: this file contains WMI executed commands on system. We can pull it andexamine it<br>
	    I wrote an example of how to do this in this post [WMI Persistence Example](https://hejelylab.github.io/blog/IRC/Persistence-WMI)<br>
