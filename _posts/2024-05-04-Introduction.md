**Description**
This post is a reflection to the first video in a series of specialized educational videos covering various important topics in cybersecurity. The series includes practical implementation and direct execution of all the ideas we discuss. The goal is to spread knowledge related to cybersecurity.

I hope one day I will provide an English version of all the content that is available in Arabic.
